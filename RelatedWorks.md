Findings state that FDI helped reduce the unemployment rate and increased the gross domestic product (GDP). A one percent increase in FDI caused a decrease of 0.009% in unemployment and an increase of 1.219% in GDP. Lin and Wang (2004) focused on the correlation between capital outflow and unemployment in G7 countries which consists of Canada, UK, US, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. The regression is estimated as a system of separate equations for the individual countries using generalized least squares (GLS). The empirical study comprises the most capital outflow countries in G7 countries and uses annual data from 1981 to 2002. FDI is found to negatively correlate with the unemployment rate in all G7 countries. 

Schemerer (2012) proposed a simple multi-industry trade model with search frictions in the labor market. The derived FDI and unemployment nexus is tested using macroeconomic data from 20 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries on unemployment FDI, and labor market institutions. The data used for observing the 20 countries were from the period of 1980-2003. The results explained that the model in the net-FDI is associated with lower rates of aggregate unemployment.
