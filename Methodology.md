This paper aims to study the relationship between FDI and unemployment rate in US in the period from 2005 to 2021 to include the USAID economic growth policy. Thus, if a relationship is to be found between FDI and unemployment, it’ll act as a powerful policy tool to reach the aim of policy regarding reducing unemployment. However, the data until 2020 will be analyzed because after that, it is considered as a preliminary data. Therefore, in an attempt to estimate this relation, this section will estimate an econometric model using the Ordinary Least Squares method (OLS). The general form of the model that to be estimated is:

$Unemployment Rate_t = α + β_1FDI_t + β_2outward_t + β_3GDP_t + β_4Inflation_t+ ϵ_t$

Accordingly, this study will consider unemployment rate as the dependent variable. Then, it will be explained through the OLS model by four control variables: net FDI inflows as a percentage of GDP, exports as a percentage of GDP, growth rate of GDP and inflation rate measured by CPI. Annual Data were collected about the four independent variables and the dependent variable from the [data source] OECD . Nevertheless, to proceed with the analysis, there are number of assumptions that need to be satisfied in order to guarantee the adequacy of the model and the reliability of its results. They are some assumptions to be satisfied in order for the estimated parameters of the model to be BLUE “the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator”
