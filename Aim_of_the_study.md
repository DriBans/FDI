This paper aims to examine the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the unemployment rate and economic growth in in the world (G20 countries which is the assembly for international economic corporations) from 2005 to 2021. The macroeconomic stability and the labor market of an economy have been identified by the literature, as some of the main aspects that are analyzed by foreign investors before deciding for a future host country. The reverse impact is also mentioned by the researcher who provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that FDI bring important benefits to a host country. Consequently, studying the interdependencies between the inflow of FDI and the unemployment becomes of high importance for each country which shows increased interest in attracting foreign direct investments. The ordinary least squares method is employed to analyze the data in this study. Findings indicate that FDI helped reduce the unemployment rate and increased the gross domestic product (GDP). A 1% increase in FDI caused a decrease of 0.009% in unemployment and an increase of 1.219% in GDP. These findings are highly important in policy formulation and implementation. The government should be concerned about FDI, which can benefit the Malaysian economy. FDI can also create more domestic jobs and intensify the economic growth of the country.
