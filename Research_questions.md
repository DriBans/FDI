Research questions:
-	Assess the impact of FDI on the unemployment rate
-	Test the relationship between FDI and unemployment rate
-	Propose for further research. (As I have one semester, so it will be short yet intensive, but if there is an opportunity to study further on this topic, I hope that I can transfer this research to another school  for advanced study where I will be doing another master or PhD).

There will be a few techniques for the analysis. One is based on Toda Yamamoto Causality analysis which is a statistical test for determining whether one time series is useful for forecasting another. 

Hypothesis 1: the one variable doesn’t granger cause for the other variable.
Hypothesis 2: the second variable doesn’t granger cause for the first variable.

Second is to do hypothesis testing

Hypothesis 1: The inflow of FDI influences the unemployment rate in a country. 
Hypothesis 2: The unemployment rate has an influence on the inflow of FDI attracted by a country.

Third is to do a unit root test, multicollinearity, regression estimator. 

(Please note that there will be more tests depending on the data such as causality test, cointegration test, etc.)

Here are the lists of test from the resources:
- Toda Yamamoto Causality analysis
- cointegration test- Johansen, Engle–Granger two-step method, Phillips–Ouliaris cointegration test, Multicollinearity, Bayesian inference
- Harris- Todaro economic model
- the unit root test of augmented Dickey-Fuller test statistics
- variance decomposition (?)
- Panel Cointegration test
