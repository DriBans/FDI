### FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)

My CAPSTONE project for my master will be about "how COVID impacts on psychological stress" using statistical analysis, and possibly data analysis. It will be short as this is due one semester. Here is the dataset that I have got from [COVIDiStress data](https://osf.io/af926).

`
The COVIDiSTRESS global survey is an international collaborative undertaking for data gathering on human experiences, behavior and attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the survey focuses on psychological stress, compliance with behavioral guidelines to slow the spread of Coronavirus, and trust in governmental institutions and their preventive measures, but multiple further items and scales are included for descriptive statistics, further analysis and comparative mapping between participating countries. Round one data collection was concluded May 30. 2020.

To gather comparable data swiftly from across the globe, when the Coronavirus started making a critical impact on societies and individuals, the collaboration and survey was constructed as an urgent collaborative process. Individual contributors and groups in the COVIDiSTRESS network (see below) conducted translations to each language and shared online links by their own best means in each country `

The aim of this project is to develop research data on how  using statistical analysis. The research related to this topic is insufficient, and thereby, hoping to study this further for my PhD topic (Not confirmed).

There will be many files in this project because it will be hard to read in one long-lengthed file and the performance will be better when searching.
